      <h3>Artist Statement</h3>



<p>As a young artist, I intend to explore all different kinds of art in the world. Art is my passion ever since I could doodle. I like any kind art, especially abstract because it’s very freeing. Digital art is something I’m still getting used to. It’s a difficult world but I’m not opposed to trying to learn more about the ins and outs. I’ve learned about painting and ceramics; which are two methods I love. Now I intend to learn about digital art, as well.<p>
<p>I want to work with DMA and painting. I enjoy working with my hands creating ceramic pieces. I take pleasure in creating fanciful creations such as mermaids, angels, demons, faeries and anything I find mesmerizing. I enjoy working with a balance of light and dark; good and evil. I want to create art that can be beautiful, random, funny, serious, dark or anything in between.<p>
<p>I hope to capture my audience's attention. I want them to feel inspired and ask questions. I want my art to feel like it’s telling a story or send a message about something that inspires me.<p>
<p>I started out drawing and doodling as a kid. Prior to college I had only known drawing and painting. As a college student I have explored metal work, ceramics, digital art, and the art of woodworking. The art I’m working on right now - my digital art - relates to my previous work and gives my art a step up. The art itself tells me how far I’ve come as an artist, yet I’ve only just scratched the surface of becoming an artist. There is so much I have yet to explore and I can’t wait.<p>
<p>As a young artist, I am still dabbling in whatever medium interests me. I have yet to explore where my work fits in with current contemporary art today. There are times when I get inspiration from nature, or the internet or when viewing works done by other artists. I become inspired and want to try and see if I can recreate their technique. I don’t plan ahead of time on what the text is about. This happens either during or after I create my art pieces. A change of scenery surprisingly helps as well to spark my inspiration.<p>
<p>There is an artist named Margaret Cerutti who seems to love painting the outdoors and lighting. According to Cerutti, “Capturing the light is everything.” When I see her work, it makes me want to create such beautiful work and her use of color to create snow in her landscapes are breathtaking. There’s very little defined detail in Cerutti’s work. It is as though her paintings are from a dream. I would like to create something like Cerutti; to not put effort into so much detail when I don’t need to. To not feel as though I’m tied down in creating such perfect detail.<p>
<p>My personal philosophy is that art is a wonderful way to escape reality. I believe anything can happen in art. When I open my eyes to the world - to a new view- nearly everything gives me inspiration. I think the world would be a dark and dreary place if people couldn’t express themselves through art.<p>
